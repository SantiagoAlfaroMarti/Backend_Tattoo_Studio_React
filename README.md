 ## Installation :computer:

1. If you don't have MySQL installed on you computer, you can install Docker and execute the above command on your Powershell to create a MySQL container
` $ docker run --name nombre-contenedor -p 3311:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234 -d mysql `
2. Clone the repository
` $ git clone https://github.com/SantiagoAlfaroMarti/Tattoo-Studio.git `
3. Install dependencies
` $ npm install `
4. Run server
` $ npm run dev `
5. Run migrations on DB
` $ npm run run-migrations `
6. Mock DB with seeders
` $ npm run seeds `

## Initial Approach :spiral_notepad:
<img src="./img/planteamiento_inicial.png">

## Database Diagram :chart_with_upwards_trend:
<img src="./img/diagrama.png">

## Database Relations :clipboard:
    
    - "Roles" to "Users": One-to-many relationship
    where:
      - One role can have many users.

    - "Users" to "Appointments": One-to-many relationship
    where:
      - One user can have many appointments.

    - "Services" to "Appointments": One-to-many relationship
    where:
      - One service can have many appointments.

## Problems Solutions :boxing_glove:
The greatest difficulty I have encountered has been in establishing the relationships between users, artists, appointments, roles and services. Depending on each of them, they have different unions, depending on the type of union they are linked to.
But thinking first of all about how the relationships will be, I have been able to create all the links between each one of them.

## Future Functionalities :crystal_ball:
Tattoo and piercing artists will be able to choose and update their appointments.
<br>
Include reviews of tattoo artists and piercing artists, based on customer experience.
<br>
Include the frontend part so that customers can navigate with the API, and can select the desired service.
<br>
Differentiate tattoo artists from piercing artists.
<br>

## Acknowledgements :trophy:
I would like to thank the teachers of GeeksHub Academy for their dedication and commitment to develop this first backend project.
Repeating countless times the concepts to be able to assimilate them, explaining in different ways for its understanding and looking for solutions to all the errors that appeared in the terminal.

## Development :joystick:

``` js
 const developer = "santiagoalfaro";

 console.log("Developed by: " + developer);
